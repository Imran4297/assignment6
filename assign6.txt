1. What is merge conflict?

   A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
 Git can merge the changes automatically only if the commits are on different lines or branches.

    
2.How to resolve the conflict?

  Under your repository name, click Pull requests.
  In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request with a merge conflict that you'd like to resolve.
  Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts.

3.what is difference between git fetch and git pull?

 git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original
 It doesn't do any file transferring. It's more like just checking to see if there are any changes available.
 git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.
